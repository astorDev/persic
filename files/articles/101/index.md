# S3 with C# and .NET 9: The Most Effective Way to Manage Files

Introduced by Amazon in 2006, S3 has since become the de facto standard for cloud file storage. Practically every cloud provider today offers an S3-compatible storage service (even though many fields in the S3 protocol still contain "AMZ" in their names). 

In this article, we will experiment with managing files in S3 using C#. We'll go step by step from the ground up, improving Amazon's library for our convenience along the way. Without further ado, let's set things up!

## Setting Up Local S3 Environment: MinIO & Docker

## Initial .NET Code: Connecting to S3 (MinIO instance)

## Getting Familiar with S3: Improved Connection and Buckets

## The Main Thing: File Upload and Download

## Final Chores: Improving File Access Code

## TL;DR

In this article, we've investigated integrating S3 in C#. We've covered connecting to S3, initiating a bucket, writing and reading files from it.

Along the way, we've found a few inefficiencies in the Amazon library, so we have made our own helper classes: `S3Client` and `S3BucketClient`. You can use those helpers by installing the `Persic.Files` NuGet package. With the package in place, you should be able to communicate with S3 with ease. Here's a full `Program.cs` demonstrating that:

> The example assumes a locally deployed MinIO instance. Refer to the first section of this article for details. 

```csharp
using Persic;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Logging.AddSimpleConsole(c => c.SingleLine = true);

builder.Services.AddS3("ServiceURL=http://localhost:9000;AccessKeyId=minio;SecretAccessKey=minioP@ssw0rd;ForcePathStyle=true")
    .WithBucket("my-web-app");

var app = builder.Build();

var bucket = app.Services.GetRequiredService<S3BucketClient>();

await bucket.EnsureInited();

await bucket.PutObject("hello.txt", "Hello, S3!"u8, "text/plain");

var received = await bucket.GetObject("hello.txt");
var readText = received.ResponseStream.ReadAsString();

app.Logger.LogInformation("Received: '{readText}'. Web Console: {consoleUrl}",
    readText, "http://localhost:9001");

app.Run();
```

The package, as well as this article, is part of a project called [persic](https://github.com/astorDev/persic), containing various DB-related tooling. Check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/astorDev/persic), and don't hesitate to give it a star! ‚≠ê
