# MongoDB Changes Watching using C#

> Reacting to MongoDB collection changes in .NET by using `WatchAsync` and `IChangeStreamCursor`. Plus, deploying MongoDB instance with replica set enabled locally via docker-compose.

![Listening to Mongo using .NET. Not Long-Polling]()

MongoDB is becoming an increasingly popular database option in modern systems, including those written in .NET. However, one of its advanced features - change listening, is frequently overlooked. In this article I'll shed light on that functionality, providing a ready-to-go example of listening to changes in a MongoDB collection using C#.

## Deploying and Connection to MongoDB via C#: Naive Version

`compose.yml`

```yml
services:
  mongo:
    image: mongo
    ports:
      - 27017:27017
```

```csharp
public IMongoCollection<Robot> GetCollection()
{
    var client = new MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017");
    var database = client.GetDatabase("persic-playground");
    return database.GetCollection<Robot>("robots");
}
```

```csharp
var collection = GetCollection();
await collection.Database.Ping();
```

## Wrapping Up!

After deploying MongoDB with replica set enabled we were able to listen for changes in a collection using C# code. You can find the source code for this article [here on GitHub](https://github.com/astorDev/persic/tree/main/mongo). The repository holds tools and playgrounds for various databases, beyond Mongo.
