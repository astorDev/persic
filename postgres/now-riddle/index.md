## What Will this PostgreSQL Code Print? ðŸ¤”

I couldn't believe this, at first!

Here's what I get from running the query:

```text
NOTICE: 00:00:00
DO
Total execution time: 00:00:02.072
```

**But why the result will be 00:00:00? ðŸ¤¯**

This is because **now()** return the **start** time of the current transaction; not the clock time at which the function is called. So in our case both the `first_timestamp` and the `second_timestamp` will store exactly the same time, hence producing this zero interval!
