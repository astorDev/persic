![Yet another Key-Value store with C#]()

Etcd is yet another key-value store. However, unlike Redis the database is strongly consistent, making it a better choice for storing critical data of a distributed system. 

In this article, we will deploy and play around with the database using C# and .NET. Without further ado, let's get going! 

## Recap

Here's what we have done in the article:

- Deployed local instance of etcd.
- Performed basic operations via C# code.
- Implemented change listening via `WatchRequest`
- Performed complex updates via `TxnRequest`.
